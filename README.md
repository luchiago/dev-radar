# Omnistack Week 10.0

Week promoted by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) for understanding FullStack in JavaScript (NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native) by doing an application during the week

The developed application it will be: Waze/Google Maps for developers

It will help to understand things like: how to work with geolocatization, non-relational database and, of course, about the FullStack in JavaScript

## Installation

### Requirements

* NodeJS (12.13.1)
* npm (6.13.6)
* yarn (1.17.3)
* React, React Native and Expo

## Responsability of each stack

### Back-End

Built on NodeJS, it will have a responsibility to take care of:

* Business Rules
* DB Connection
* Email sending
* Web Services communication
* User authentication
* Security and Cryptography

This is one API REST

Also, we will use the Github API to get information (such as avatar, bio) from devs

We're using `express` package, MongoDB as Non-relational DB

### Front-End

The SPA (Single-Page Application) approach will be applied here

The Front-End project is using ReactJS

### Mobile

We are going to use the React Native approach to implements mobile project. How this works? All code are made in JavaScript and the device understand this JS code.

We also are going to use Expo because makes more easly to test our application without having an MacOS or SDK from Android installed
